## Introduction

Vitalert is designed to predict seizures and provide timely assistance to individuals experiencing seizures. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time communication to analyze data from smartwatches and provide alerts and support during seizure episodes.

## How It Works

1. **Seizure Prediction**: The system continuously analyzes real-time data from smartwatches, including heart rate variability, movement patterns, and other physiological signals. Using machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), it predicts the onset of seizures with high accuracy.

2. **Assistance Protocol**: When a seizure is predicted, the system activates an assistance protocol to ensure the safety and well-being of the individual. This protocol includes:
   - Notifying the user about the predicted seizure and advising them to find a safe environment.
   - Activating alarms on the synced smartwatch and mobile app to alert the user and nearby individuals.
   - Displaying vital patient information, including medical history, allergies, and emergency contacts, on the mobile app for emergency responders.
   - Contacting emergency numbers recorded for the individual in case of unresponsiveness or inability to confirm the prediction.

3. **Real-time Communication**: The backend server communicates in real-time with smartwatches and mobile apps using WebSocket technology. This enables seamless interaction and support during seizure episodes, ensuring timely assistance and intervention.

## Key Technologies

### Vespa.ai

- **Vespa.ai**: Utilized for advanced ranking and aggregation functions to analyze real-time health data and provide personalized recommendations for seizure management strategies. Vespa.ai's cloud-based platform enables efficient data processing and decision-making, enhancing the system's effectiveness.

### Together.ai

- **Together.ai**: Collaborated with the Together.ai community to enhance machine learning models for seizure prediction by incorporating insights and techniques from open-source AI programs and models. Together.ai's platform facilitates collaboration and knowledge-sharing among AI enthusiasts, enabling continuous improvement of predictive models.

### Wispr.ai

- **Wispr.ai**: Implemented voice-activated alerts, emergency assistance, and health information retrieval using Wispr.ai's voice-based experience platform to enhance user interaction and accessibility. Wispr.ai's intuitive voice interface allows individuals to interact with the system hands-free, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### MongoDB

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving information related to user profiles, medical history, and seizure prediction data. MongoDB's flexible document model and scalability make it suitable for handling large volumes of data generated by the system.

### TensorFlow.js

- **TensorFlow.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js. TensorFlow.js is used for running machine learning algorithms on the backend server to predict seizures based on real-time data from smartwatches.

## Libraries Used
